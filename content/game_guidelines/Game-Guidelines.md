title: Game Guidelines
---

This game runs through four exciting marketing stages: Attention, Interest, Desire, and Action. In each stage, players will be faced with strategic decisions designed to experience real-life brand choices.

After making a choice, you'll have 2 minutes to pitch your reasoning and strategy. Think of it as your moment in the spotlight: explain why you picked that option, how you plan to execute it, and what outcome you expect.

Stage 3 is where things get even more real. Instead of choosing from fixed options, you'll be asked to create your own custom strategy plan complete with creative ideas and action steps.

At the end of the game, you'll see how your choices would impact Millie's business in the real world!

Psst.. psst.. Watch out, there will be huge problems that you will face at the end of the game. So, be prepared!
