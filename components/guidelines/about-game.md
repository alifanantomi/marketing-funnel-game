Welcome to From Buzz to Buy - Marketing Funnel Game-Based Learning a marketing simulation game that transforms textbook theory into real, relatable, hands-on experience. Forget passive learning. This is your chance to think, create, and compete as a real-life brand owner for a rising fashion brand named **Boots by Millie**.

Millie is a fictional but realistic local fashion brand. She's got the potential, the style, and the vision but she doesn’t have you… yet. Your job? Transform this quiet underdog into a head-turning, conversation-starting, trendsetting brand.

This isn’t just a game. It’s a crash course in the art and science of how brands:

- Capture attention
- Spark interest
- Build desire
- Inspire action

These are the four powerful stages of the **AIDA model**, one of the most fundamental frameworks in marketing history. But instead of sitting through lectures, you’ll apply it in real-time, solving creative challenges and pitching ideas just like a real brand owner would.
By the end of the game, you’ll walk away with:

- A deeper understanding of marketing psychology
- Creative thinking and campaign planning skills
- Team collaboration and presentation experience
- And of course, bragging rights, if you win!
