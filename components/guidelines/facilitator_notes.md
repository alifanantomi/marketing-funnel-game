The key to a successful facilitator is being fair, encouraging, and consistent. Use the category boards as a reference to ensure each team gets a fair evaluation, especially in merit-based stages. Stay focused on both strategic quality and presentation clarity. This guideline will help you maintain smooth gameplay while allowing players to showcase their creativity and strategic thinking.

If any uncertainties arise, discuss with fellow facilitators to reach a consensus on scoring.

Good luck and enjoy guiding the game!
