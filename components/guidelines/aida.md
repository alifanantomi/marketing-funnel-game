Let’s break it down:

**AIDA stands for:**

- **Attention** – How do you get noticed in a sea of content?  
- **Interest** – How do you keep people intrigued?  
- **Desire** – How do you make them emotionally want what you’re offering?  
- **Action** – How do you convince them to take that final step?

Each stage reflects the journey of a potential customer, from unaware to loyal fan.  
In this game, you’ll journey through these four stages by solving **mission-based challenges**. Think of AIDA as your cheat code.
