# From Buzz to Buy - Marketing Funnel Game-Based Learning: Game Guidebook

## 1. What’s This Game All About?

Welcome to **From Buzz to Buy**, a marketing simulation game that transforms textbook theory into real, relatable, hands-on experience. 

Forget passive learning. This is your chance to **think, create, and compete** as a real-life brand owner for a rising fashion brand named **Boots by Millie**.

Millie is a fictional but realistic local fashion brand. She's got the potential, the style, and the vision — but she doesn’t have *you*… yet.  
**Your job?** Transform this quiet underdog into a trendsetting brand.

This isn’t just a game. It’s a crash course in how brands:

- Capture attention  
- Spark interest  
- Build desire  
- Inspire action

You’ll apply the **AIDA model** in real-time, solving creative challenges and pitching ideas just like a real brand owner would.

### By the end of the game, you’ll walk away with:

- A deeper understanding of marketing psychology  
- Creative thinking and campaign planning skills  
- Team collaboration and presentation experience  
- And of course, bragging rights — if you win!

## 2. Meet AIDA: Your Secret Marketing Weapon

Let’s break it down:

**AIDA stands for:**

- **Attention** – How do you get noticed in a sea of content?  
- **Interest** – How do you keep people intrigued?  
- **Desire** – How do you make them emotionally want what you’re offering?  
- **Action** – How do you convince them to take that final step?

Each stage reflects the journey of a potential customer, from unaware to loyal fan.  
In this game, you’ll journey through these four stages by solving **mission-based challenges**. Think of AIDA as your cheat code.
