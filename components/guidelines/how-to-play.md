### Team Setup

- Teams of 3 to 5 members  
- Each team represents Millie as the brand owner  
- Shared mission: create your brand journey using smart, strategic, and compelling marketing moves  
- Solo mode works too for individual practice

### Structure

The game has five parts:

1. Attention  
2. Interest  
3. Desire  
4. Action  
5. **Bonus Stage**: Risk Management (Crisis Round)

Each stage introduces a unique challenge that corresponds with the AIDA model.  
Scoring is based on **Engagement Points (EP)** â€” the more compelling and creative your solution, the higher your score.
